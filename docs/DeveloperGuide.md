### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java))
is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `TutorialListPanel`, `AttendanceListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

In addition to having simple single-word command,
our app supports commands with subcommands (e.g. `tutorial add`, `tutorial delete`).
Our implementation is similar to that of a Recursive Descent Parser.

Here is a (partial) diagram showing how the recursive parsing works,
using the `TutorialParser` as an example
(classes not involved are omitted):

<img src="images/TutorialClassDiagram.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

1. The `AddressBookParser` will match the first word,
   and match against a `Command` object, or another `Parser` object
   - The algorithm terminates if it maps to a `Command` object.
1. If it maps to a `Parser` object,
   then it will call `Parser#parse` of that object
   - The `parse` method will map the next word to either a `Command` or `Parser` object.
   - The process repeats recursively until it eventually resolves to a `Command` object.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.svg" width="550" />

(Implementation within the addressbook will be discussed in another section)

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data, `Student`, `Tutorial`, `Attendance` and `Submission`.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Student`, `Tutorial`, `Attendance` and `Submission` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain,
  they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

#### AddressBook Component

The above diagram shows how the `AddressBook` class, and `ModelManager` classes interact with
the `Tutorial`, `Student`, `Attendance` and `Submission` class.
This section will describe the interaction between these classes.

<img src="images/AddressBookClassDiagram.svg" width="450" />

In the `AddressBook` class,
between each `(Student, Tutorial)` Pair,
there is one `Attendance` object.
Each `Attendance` object stores an array of integers,
where the `i`th index represents the `i`'th lesson,
and the value in the `i`th index could be 0 or 1,
representing whether the student was present during that lesson.
Between each `(Assignment, Student)` pair,
there is a `Submission` object.
In each `Submission` object is an enum that represents the submission status of that assignment,
for a particular student.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Student functionality

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components,
for executing the 3 key commands for functionalities related to students in TAskbook.

#### `add` Command

#### `edit` Command

   Automatically update submission records when students are added/removed from tutorials using t/ tag in add/edit commands.  
   _Example_: edit 1 t/CS2103_T01 will now sync all CS2103_T01 submissions.

2. Persistent Description Field:  
   Save student descriptions between sessions in the data file.  
   _Implementation_: New "description" field in student JSON structure.

3. Export Completeness:  
   Include full submission histories and attendance records in exports.  
   _New Files_:

- submissions.csv (all submission states with timestamps)
- attendance.csv (weekly records per student-tutorial pair)

4. Enhanced Error Messages:  
   Specific warnings for:

- Invalid parameters (show expected format)
- Duplicate tutorial additions ("Tutorial already exists: CS2103*T01")  
  \_Example*: tutorial add CS2103_T01 â†’ "Operation failed: Tutorial already exists"

5. Window Auto-Resizing:  
   Dynamic UI adjustment for long content (names, descriptions, assignments).  
   _Thresholds_:

- Auto-expand for >15 character assignments
- Scrollable panels for >30 character descriptions

6. Data Preloading:  
   Load student data on application startup instead of first list command.

7. Session State Preservation:  
   Maintain temporary data between app restarts:

- Active filters
- Description edits
- Current view preferences  
  _Storage_: New session.json file in data directory.

8. Help Window Management:  
   Proper handling of minimized help windows with new instances.  
   _Fix_: Detect and restore/minimize state on help commands
